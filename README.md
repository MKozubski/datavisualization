Data Visualization

This is a collection of data visualization options, maps, charts etc..

This is not a plug in or standalone solution, it is a simply a collection of data visualization options, in which leaflet, deck.gl and many others are used to oft time produce the same result. The purpose of this pack is to archive options, not provide working solutions or show the most efficient method. Code samples are very basic and serve to show the necessary parts to construct such components. 

This is not meant for public use, it's simply an archive of options I have developed in testing/practice.
