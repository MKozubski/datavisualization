Data Visualization

This is a collection of data visualization options, maps, charts ect.

This is not a plug in or standalone solution, it is a simply a collection of data visualization options, in which leaflet, deck.gl and many others are used to oft time produce the same result. The purpose of this pack is to archieve options, not provide working solutions or show the most effcient method. Code samples are very basic and serve to show the nessasary parts to contruct such components. 

This is not meant for public use, simple an archieve of options I have developed in testing/practice.
